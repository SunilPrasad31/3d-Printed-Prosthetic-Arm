# 3D Printed Prosthetic Arm

This repository contains the design files and instructions for building a 3D printed prosthetic arm. Our goal is to provide an affordable solution that can be accessed by individuals from all walks of life, with a total cost below â‚¹10,000.

## Features
- Fully customizable design
- Open-source and freely available
- Compatible with standard 3D printers
- Modular design for easy assembly and adjustments
- Lightweight and comfortable for daily use
- Adaptable for both left and right arms

## Components
- **3D Printed Parts**: STL files for all components
- **Hardware**: List of required screws, nuts, bolts, etc.
- **Assembly Instructions**: Step-by-step guide for assembly
- **Electronics**: Optional electronics for advanced functionality, within budget constraints

## Getting Started
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. 3D print the components using the provided STL files or utilize affordable 3D printing services.
3. Source the necessary hardware according to the provided list, ensuring cost-effectiveness.
4. Follow the assembly instructions carefully, prioritizing cost-efficient methods and materials.
5. Customize the design as needed for individual requirements, while keeping costs in mind.
6. Optionally, integrate electronics for additional features within the budget limit.

## Testing and Feedback
We encourage users to test the prosthetic arm and provide feedback on its usability and cost-effectiveness. Your input will help us refine the design and identify areas for further cost reduction.

## Contributing
